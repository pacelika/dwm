# DWM refactored

Suckless DWM source code refactored 
<br />
Optionally you can use Lua for DWM hooks and behavior without recompiling. This config file lives in ~/.config/dwm/config.lua
<br />
<br />
You can disable Lua in the project by setting the LUA_RC flag set to OFF,e.g: cmake -D LUA_RC=OFF<br />
